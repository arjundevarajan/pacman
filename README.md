I did this project in Python for my CS 270: Intro to Artificial Intelligence class at Duke. This is a standard project done for most undergraduate artificial intelligence classes. 

NOTE: Most of the classes have been written by a combination of John DeNero and Dan Klein at UC-Berkeley, while some code was written by Ron Parr at Duke. Only files with "Modified by Arjun Devarajan" in the header were affeted by me. 

# Project 1: Search
The first folder project, search, explores various search algorithms, such as depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), uniform cost search (UCS), and A* search (with multiple heuristics). The link to the assignment can be found here: http://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/spring16/compsci270/hw1/. 

# Project 2: Multiagent Search
The second folder project, multiagent, explores adversarial search and implements several algorithms, including minimax, alpha-beta pruning, and expectimax. The link to the assignment can be found here: http://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/spring16/compsci270/hw2/.
